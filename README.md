# Image-Classification
This project classifies parking spaces as "empty" or "not empty" using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). It processes images, resizes them to 15x15 pixels, and applies GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. After training, the model's accuracy is evaluated, and the best-performing model is saved for future use in parking space detection systems.
